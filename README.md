## Projects

### Airbnb After Covid Analysis: 
Conducted an in-depth exploration of Airbnb market dynamics in Los Angeles pre- and post-COVID-19. This analysis included examining pricing trends, minimum stay requirements, availability fluctuations, and review frequency. Techniques included statistical trend analysis and correlation assessments, revealing shifts toward longer-term rentals post-pandemic. Additionally, sentiment and keyword analysis identified successful listing characteristics and emphasized host responsiveness and location-related factors influencing listing popularity and guest satisfaction.

### Booking Customer Reviews Analysis:
  This project involved analyzing patterns and sentiment in luxury hotel reviews across Europe. Techniques used included Simple Linear Regression (SLR) to assess the relationship between review frequency and scores. Despite statistical significance, results revealed a negligible practical impact, suggesting other factors like qualitative sentiment analysis could be more influential.

### Employee Satisfaction Analysis: 
Explored key determinants of employee job satisfaction through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and two-sample statistical tests. Examined variables like monthly income, distance from home, company culture, job security, and work-life balance. Results indicated monthly income significantly impacts satisfaction, while other factors showed varying levels of significance, suggesting deeper insights could be obtained through additional interaction analyses.
